Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. It is designed to be simple and flexible, with a small core and modular design. Flask provides tools and libraries for building web applications, such as URL routing, template rendering, and request handling. It also supports the use of third-party libraries to add functionality as needed. Flask is widely used for developing web applications, APIs, and dynamic websites due to its simplicity and ease of use.
