# Whoosh

Whoosh is a Replit extension to allow you to view documentation for a large variety of languages and packages inside the Replit workspace! 

## Support

This project is extremely large and will take up a large portion of my time. If you like it, consider giving the repo a star, following me [on Replit](https://replit.com/@DillonB07), or buying me a coffee!
