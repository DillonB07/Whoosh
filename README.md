# Whoosh

Whoosh is a Replit extension to allow you to view documentation for a large variety of languages and packages inside the Replit workspace! 

## Support

This project is extremely large and will take up a large portion of my time. If you like it, consider giving it a star, following me on Replit, or sponsoring me (coming soon)!

## Contributing

If you want to help with the project, I would really appreciate it!
I would love help with parsing documentation and converting it into Markdown to be used by the extension as that will be extremely time consuming (and boring)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](#CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on contributing.
